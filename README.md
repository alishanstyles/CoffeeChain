# Coffee Chain Project

## Problem Statement 
-This data can be used to identify the sales of Coffee at a coffee chain throughout the United States. This prediction model can give insight to cofee chains that are interested in the factors that may affect the sales of their coffee as well as knowing what are the best selling products and the least selling products; how much is spent in manufacturing those products and the profit made. 
-The data looks at a coffee chain through out the United Sates in the central, west, south and east regions. The columns consist of Product ID, Product Type, State, Market, Profit, Cogs, Product, Type, Market Size, Budget Sales, Budget Profit, Sales, Total Expenses and Date. These are the factors that contribute to the sale of the products. 

## Modeling Process
I beleive my model will generalize to new data because it performed well to the that it has not seen. I demonstrated feature engineering by selecting features relevant to Sale. I also used visulizations such as a heat map to gain insight on the fatures with significant correlation to the target and improved the model. The baseline score was 96%. I created a linear regression model using 'Product Id', 'Product Type Num', 'Product Category', 'Type of Coffee', 'Size of Market', 'Market Location', 'Budget Sales', 'Budget Profit', 'Cogs','States' as features. Using these features the test score for the RMSE was
